PROBLEM STATEMENT

While St. Patrick's Hospital diligently serves its community, a comprehensive understanding of its operational dynamics and patient profiles remains a largely untapped resource. These Questions linger: 

What are the most prevalent medical conditions driving hospital billing? 
How has the average length of patient stay evolved over time? 
Which medications are most frequently prescribed? 
Are there discernible patterns in patient demographics or insurance coverage that influence healthcare delivery? 
Without a systematic analysis of this wealth of data, opportunities for improvement, efficiency gains, and a deeper understanding of patient needs may be overlooked. 
This project seeks to address this gap by transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.

The visual nature of the dashboard allowed for rapid identification of patterns, outliers, and correlations that might not be readily apparent in raw data tables. This "show, don't tell" approach enabled a more engaging and accessible understanding of the hospital's operational landscape.

PRE-ANALYSIS

Before diving into complex diagnostics and correlations, the preliminary overview painted an intriguing picture:

Total Revenue

Top Billed Conditions

Most Common Condition

Most Frequent Admission Type

Most Used Medication

Top Billing Insurer

Common Blood Types
These key markers provided a roadmap for deeper exploration, revealing not just hospital performance, but systemic imbalances masked by surface success.

IN-ANALYSIS 

1. Billing by Medical Condition

Michael Smith treats 27 patients, while his peers average around 18. This imbalance hints at either his overqualification or misaligned patient assignment. Beyond burnout risks, such skewness impacts care quality and turnaround times.

3. Medication vs. Test Results

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e9215b-77e5-47d2-ba3f-ee0ad2973947)

Lipitor and Ibuprofen dominate prescriptions, each exceeding 11,000 instances. However, Ibuprofen shows a higher rate of abnormal test results, suggesting possible overprescription or patient incompatibility. Interestingly, Paracetamol and Aspirin, though slightly less used, exhibit better result consistency.

4. Insurance Provider Billing
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa885027-13a0-42cc-b941-fb9137c22b1f)

Cigna and Medicare contribute nearly 40% of total revenue, while Aetna trails behind them despite being a major player. A close audit could uncover underbilling, rejected claims, or longer reimbursement cycles causing inefficiencies.

5. Admission Type and Stay Duration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7beb3503-d6e0-4f75-930a-cc38235859b4)

Elective admissions outnumber emergencies and urgent, with an average stay of 16 days. This could stretch hospital resources and slow down emergency responses. Emergencies, despite their intensity, last a day shorter, reflecting higher efficiency or perhaps, faster discharges.

6. Blood Type Trends

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b58c7ca6-aec9-40f0-b47e-43bd5b80de0b)

A+ and A- dominate the patient pool, while O- (the universal donor) is less common. Emergency preparedness must align with this insight to ensure blood banks maintain optimal stock.

7. Test Result Breakdown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c30040-26aa-4781-b71a-29437f50d56b)

Normal test results (18,198) are nearly equal to both abnormal (18,437) and inconclusive (18,331) ones. The high rate of unclear diagnostics raises a red flag for lab operations, calibration protocols, and overall diagnostic workflows.

8. Yearly and Monthly Admission Trends:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e4bdd7-431b-4f6a-8be7-c2dc2e0ff48b)

There is consistent admissions (51–52 Yearly and Monthly) showing no significant seasonal fluctuations.
This indicates that there is predictable resource allocation, which shows the little need for seasonal staffing changes.


IN-ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

Our deep dive into the data revealed several compelling narratives:

Financial Landscape: The total revenue generated by hospital billing from 2019 to 2024 stood at a substantial $1,404,060,339.23. Examining billing by medical condition highlighted "Diabetes" and "Obesity" as significant contributors to hospital revenue, closely followed by "Arthritis" and "Hypertension." This suggests a high prevalence and potentially complex management of these chronic conditions within the hospital's patient population. Billing by insurance provider indicated that "Cigna" and "Medicare" accounted for the largest proportions of billed amounts.

Patient Flow and Length of Stay: The average yearly admission trend showed some fluctuation over the years, peaking in 2021 and 2022. The length of stay analysis by admission type revealed a near equal distribution between "Elective" and "Emergency" admissions, with "Urgent" cases representing a smaller fraction. This balance suggests the hospital caters to both scheduled and acute care needs.

Medication and Testing Patterns: "Lipitor" emerged as the most frequently used medication based on test results, followed closely by "Ibuprofen." This points towards a significant patient population managing cholesterol and pain-related conditions. The test result types indicated a large proportion of "Normal" results, alongside notable numbers of "Abnormal" and "Inconclusive" findings, highlighting the importance of diagnostic testing.

Patient Demographics: The average number of patients per doctor was observed to be 27. Patient count by blood type revealed a relatively even distribution across the major blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-), with a slightly lower representation of O+ and O-.

Key Findings and Insights

Synthesizing the analysis, several key findings and insightful observations emerged:

Dominance of Chronic Conditions: The significant billing associated with Diabetes, Obesity, Arthritis, and Hypertension underscores the hospital's role in managing chronic diseases within its community. This highlights the need for robust chronic disease management programs and patient education initiatives.

Balanced Admission Types: The near parity between elective and emergency admissions suggests a comprehensive healthcare service offering, catering to both planned treatments and urgent medical needs. Efficient management of both admission streams is crucial for optimal resource utilization.

High Utilization of Specific Medications: The prevalence of Lipitor and Ibuprofen prescriptions indicates common health concerns within the patient population, such as hyperlipidemia and pain management. Understanding the reasons behind this high utilization can inform formulary management and potential preventative care strategies.

Significant Insurance Provider Concentration: The large proportion of billing attributed to Cigna and Medicare suggests the importance of maintaining strong relationships with these providers and understanding their specific requirements and patient populations.

Relatively Consistent Patient Load per Doctor: An average of 27 patients per doctor provides a benchmark for workload management and staffing considerations. Monitoring this metric over time can help identify potential imbalances.
